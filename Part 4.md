## A Short Roadmap
Well then. Our homework for today is:

* A public list of pastes
* Being able to unlist and protect pastes

Let's get crackin'.

## A Public Paste List
We're finally at the point where we need to split off from our view and edit pages, and create a new one. So fire up your editor because it's time to write some more HTML.

For the most part the page should be rather simple-- just a listing of some number of recent pastes plus a page navigation to go back and forth in time. We will call this `list.ctml`.

```HTML

```
